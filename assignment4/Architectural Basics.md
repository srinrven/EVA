How many layers,
MaxPooling,
1x1 Convolutions,
3x3 Convolutions,
Receptive Field,
SoftMax,
Learning Rate,
Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
Batch Normalization,
Image Normalization,
Position of MaxPooling,
Concept of Transition Layers,
Position of Transition Layer,
Number of Epochs and when to increase them,
DropOut
When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (which we have not yet covered)
How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
Batch Size, and effects of batch size
When to add validation checks
LR schedule and concept behind it
Adam vs SGD
