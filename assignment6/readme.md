Run this network(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1STOg33u7haqSptyjUL40FZIxNW4XdBQK). After training the network, whatever accuracy you get is your base accuracy. Epochs = 100
Fix the network above:
remove dense
add layers required to reach RF
fix kernel scaleup and down (1x1)
see if all dropouts are properly placed
follow the guidelines we discussed in the class (
Get accuracy more than the base accuracy in less number 100 epochs. Hint, you might want to use "border_mode='same',"

Rewrite it again using these convolutions in the order given below:
Normal Convolution
Separable Convolution 
Depthwise Convolution
Grouped Convolution (use 3x3, 5x5 only)
Grouped Convolution (use 3x3 only, one with dilation = 1, and another with dilation = 2) 
You must use all of the 5 above at least once
Train this new model for 50 epochs.

Total Score of 600. 400 for Code (300+100), and 200 for documentation (100+100)
Upload the github folder link which has both the files.
